BepInEx Plugin for doing stuff with the Lore Store in For The King II. It's possible to cheat add lore books, remove them, make locked items purchaseable and make hidden items purchaseable.

The mod adds the following hotkeys (After using a Hotkey, if you already entered the Lore Store you need to leave and reenter):

- LeftShift + F2: Add 50 Lore
- LeftShift + F3: Make all items purchaseable
- LeftShift + F4: Make only hidden items purchaseable
- LeftShift + F5: Make only visible items purchaseable
- LeftShift + F6: Buy everything
- LeftShift + F7: Buy everything visible
- LeftShift + F8: Remove 50 Lore
- LeftShift + F9: Sell everything. Refunds every purchase (but still keeps everything unlocked).
- LeftShift + F10: Reset the state of the Lore Shop to its default state.
