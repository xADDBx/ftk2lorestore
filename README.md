BepInEx Plugin to unlock and purchase all Lore Items in For The King II.

**Some items that can be bought multiple items are only automatically bought once. I added a Hotkey (LeftShift + F2) which adds 50 Lore currency to allow manually purchasing the remaining tiers if needed.** (When used in the Lore Store, the currency needs to be refreshed by leaving and reentering the store.)

### Installation

Download the BepInEx Package from the Releases and unzip into your game directory to set it up.
